# SINA — Integrated Academic Navigation System

SINA (Integrated Academic Navigation System) is a web-based academic management platform designed to improve usability, performance, and efficiency in higher education learning environments.

This project was developed as a **Graduation Project (TCC)** for the Systems Analysis and Development program at **UniSenai – Joinville**, addressing real limitations found in traditional Learning Management Systems (LMS), such as information fragmentation, slow navigation, and excessive user interactions.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Most traditional LMS platforms prioritize feature breadth over usability. As a result, students and professors face:

- Excessive navigation steps for simple tasks  
- Fragmented academic information across multiple screens  
- Increased cognitive load and time wasted on routine actions  

These issues negatively impact productivity, engagement, and the overall learning experience.

---

## 🎯 Solution

SINA was designed as a **centralized, high-usability academic platform**, focusing on:

- Reducing navigation complexity  
- Centralizing academic content and tasks  
- Improving performance and responsiveness  
- Providing clear dashboards for students and professors  

The system consolidates activities, materials, evaluations, and performance metrics into a single, intuitive interface.

## 📊 Key Results (MVP Validation)

Quantitative validation against the legacy LMS demonstrated:

- **52.5% reduction in the number of clicks**
- **76.6% reduction in task execution time**
- **Up to 88.5% less time** for professors to create and evaluate activities
- Faster response times and improved perceived performance
- Reduced cognitive load for students and instructors

These results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and UX decisions.
